Title: Bad Bootloader Batch
Message:
```
Yeah, use the turret arduino for now, it seems that a batch of arduinos had their bootloaders corrupted. If you have the wires, you could do this https://discord.com/channels/1229106258749948056/1304473086560829481/1304473086560829481

Otherwise if you don't have the hardware for that you could DM Tom for a replacement arduino

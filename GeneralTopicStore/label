Title: X Axis Stepper Will Not Move
Message:
Push Arduino into breadboard, it will likely click into place. if that doesn't work, try swapping which motor is plugged into which driver. You might have to unscrew the driver from the wall. See if the issue swaps to the other motor or if the x axis stepper still won't move.

Title: Running Extremely Slow
Message:
Flash the label code to the domino arduino. You can use the video at https://ide.crunchlabs.com/downloads to set it up.
If it works with the domino arduino, try reflashing code to the label arduino, if it still isn't working send a DM to @ tom_crunchlabs with your shipping address and he'll send you a replacement arduino for free.

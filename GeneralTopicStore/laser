Title: Swap Gun and Goggles
Message:
First, unplug the gun from the goggles on each and swap it. Keep track of which gun does not work. If the same gun does not work, it's on the gun side (IR emitter) that it is not working, if it swaps to being the other gun, it is on the goggle side (IR receiver) that it is not working.

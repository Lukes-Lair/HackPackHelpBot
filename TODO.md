Confirm error catching works

Slowly work on more advanced+flexible flowchart parsing.

Splice embed answers to not crash on flowchart loops.

"Start Over" at the end, and "Back" buttons in flowchart... likely processing flowcharts into json and caching is actually the best idea?

Figure out why half the time, puppeteer doesn't work properly.

Double check regex anchoring in mermaid parsing (to allow comments)

git ignore the help files loaded so that they don't get overridden with commits

Scanning submitted mermaid files for errors

MarkRobot pings + killswitch

JSON decode handling on mark robot

Longer term:
- Split answers out into more embeds (current max with 1 embed is 25 answers logged)
